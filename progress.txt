=== Calculator Project Progress ===
Last Updated: 2025-11-13

Completed Tasks
---------------
[✓] Analyzed reference implementation (pc_release/)
[✓] Designed new architecture with 8 modules + main
[✓] Created folder structure (src/, include/ with subdirectories)
[✓] Created skeleton header files with Doxygen documentation
[✓] Created skeleton source files with TODOs
[✓] Created Makefile (Linux)
[✓] Created Makefile.win (Windows)

Module Status
-------------
core/bignum:          Not Started - Core BigNum structure and utilities
core/bignum_ops:      Not Started - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
core/bignum_math:     Not Started - Advanced operations (^, !)
conversion/converter: Not Started - Input format parsing (bin, hex, dec → BigNum)
conversion/formatter: Not Started - Output formatting (BigNum → bin, hex, dec)
expression/parser:    Not Started - Expression parsing (tokenization, Shunting Yard)
expression/evaluator: Not Started - Expression evaluation (postfix processing)
app/calculator:       Not Started - Application logic and command processing
app/utils:            Not Started - String utilities and I/O helpers
main:                 Not Started - Entry point and argument handling

Next Session Plan
-----------------
1. Implement utils module first (needed by other modules)
2. Implement core/bignum module (fundamental data structure)
3. Implement core/bignum_ops (basic arithmetic)
4. Test basic operations with simple examples

Architecture Decisions
----------------------
- Using decimal string representation internally (simpler than pseudo-hex)
- Separate input parsing (converter) from output formatting (formatter)
- Separate expression parsing from evaluation
- Following Single Responsibility Principle
- All modules use camelCase naming convention
- Full Doxygen documentation in headers

Open Questions / Decisions Needed
----------------------------------
- Factorial optimization strategy (recursive vs iterative vs tree-based)
- Division algorithm choice (long division vs binary search)
- Memory management strategy for intermediate results

Known Issues / TODOs
--------------------
- All functions are currently placeholders
- Need to implement comprehensive error handling
- Need to add input validation throughout
- Consider adding unit tests for each module

Design Differences from Reference
----------------------------------
✓ Different data structure (decimal vs pseudo-hex)
✓ Different module names and organization
✓ Simpler single-number-type approach
✓ Separated converter/formatter responsibilities
✓ Separated parser/evaluator responsibilities
✓ Different function naming conventions
